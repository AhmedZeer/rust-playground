# Rust Snippets.
This repository contains a couple of Rust packages that I have created for learning purposes.  
It is heavily inspired by the book [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) 

----------
## What I learned in each package
### Hello
* Variable declarations. (`let t`, `let t: u64`)
* Function call and mutable syntax. (`fn foo(mut a: u32)`)
* Macro declarations. (`whatever!()`)
* Return values with no keyword. (`n`)
* Machine specific word size. (`isize`, `usize`)
* Function attribute & Unit testing. (`#[test]`)
